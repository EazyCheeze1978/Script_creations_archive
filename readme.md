# A (hopefully!) growing collection of my little script creations that can hopefully help out various communities!

[But not growing anymore - I have chosen to fork all of my current and upcoming projects and archive this repo. Please see my profile for my hopefully ever-growing list of practical repos!]

## "CursorCommander" (thanks for the cheese there, ChatGPT)

See the [README within its folder](RestoreCursorWhenLaunchBoxCloses/readme.md) for more info, but this is a little script that will help restore the default Windows mouse cursor scheme (so far!) when the emulator front-ends LaunchBox or BigBox close.

Soon to get its own folder, its own genericized version with user-selectable processes and content to capture and restore once said processes have terminated. PLEASE give advice on how this can be accomplished! Thank you!
